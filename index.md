# Sonia Verma Writing Portfolio

Hello! Welcome to my writing portfolio page.

I am technical writer with approximately 10 years of technical writing experience. In the first 9 years, I have worked with three different product companies: MediaWide (Advertising), Avaya (Telecommunication and Networking), Veritas (Backup and Storage). During these nine years, I worked as part of a writing team and created different end-user product manuals, such as, user guides, administrator guides, installation guides, command-reference guides, and solution guides. For last one and a half years, I am working with Elavon (FinTech) as a developer documentation specialist (API Technical Writer). I work on a card-not-present fraud prevention product (APIs) primarily based on EMVco 3-D Secure guidelines. I have created the developer documentation of this product, which has a server, a websdk, and two mobile SDKs, from scratch.
